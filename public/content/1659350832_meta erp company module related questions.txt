when we do not have SO-recruit OR SO-mp then the amount calculated (while creating rewards) goes to company.
I Got the above point,


I need to discuss about company,


will company be any user who can login and manage its employees,

-----------------------------------------------
if yes

will we need to calculate sales rewards and other rewards? if yes
then what will be the citeria to calculate rewards,

-----------------------------------------------
if no then

To achieve that,
we need to create screens to (add, create and update) OR (manage) companies,
Each and every user except (admins and super-admins) associated to a company
while creating employees (admin and super admins) will be able to select company to associate that user to the company,
and company management only be accessible by (super-admin, admin, and MP of that company)


we must have a company table in data base
company table columns are 
-id (unique)
-name (company name)
-account (amount of company)

and then users table must have a company_id column in both cases
